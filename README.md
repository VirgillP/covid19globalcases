My first Julia repository

I learned about julia first in April 2020 but took interest in it two months later when I started learning about plotting.

From the Julia Academy lecture about data manipulation I made use of the Johns Hopkins covid19 times series where I build my
first graph using plotting.

Working on the file still. Do mind my comments

# Covid19 global cases

Using up-to-date data from the Github COVID-19 Data Repository (by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University) a plot graph can be represented with julia programming.
The final plotted graph is an attempt (the result of my work so far) to achieve the result as presented
with the online course of Julia Academy

## Installation

To be able to achieve this plotted graph one need to read the documentation of julia programming(https://julialang.org/), the use of Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/) a code editor of your own choice and additional packages. I will lay out a full installation guide of my own experience in due time.


```bash
brew install foobar. Full installation guidance will follow soon
```

## Usage

```julia
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```

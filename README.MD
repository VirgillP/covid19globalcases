# Covid19 global cases

Using up-to-date data from the Github COVID-19 Data Repository (by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University) a plot graph can be represented with julia programming.
The final plotted graph is an attempt (the result of my work so far) to achieve the result as presented
with the Julia Academy online course.

## Installation

To achieve a plotted graph one need to read the documentation of julia programming(https://julialang.org/), make use of use of Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), or a suitable code editor and additional package software. Code editors I make use of are Atom with the juno package AKA JuliaPro and Visual Studio Code. There is much on the internet to learn about the Julia programming language. Online free courses, videos, lectures from Julia Academy and reading material are part of many resources one can make use of. And feel free to engage with the Julia community to learn more.


## Usage
My plotted graph has been tested on both Windows and MacOS platform.
Comments and how-I-got-to-do-it steps are available in the covid19globalcases.ipynb file itself.
